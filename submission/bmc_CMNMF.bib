abstract = {Understanding the categorization of human diseases is critical for reliably identifying disease causal genes. Recently, genome-wide studies of abnormal chromosomal locations related to diseases have mapped >2000 phenotype-gene relations, which provide valuable information for classifying diseases and identifying candidate genes as drug targets. In this article, a regularized non-negative matrix tri-factorization (R-NMTF) algorithm is introduced to co-cluster phenotypes and genes, and simultaneously detect associations between the detected phenotype clusters and gene clusters. The R-NMTF algorithm factorizes the phenotype-gene association matrix under the prior knowledge from phenotype similarity network and protein-protein interaction network, supervised by the label information from known disease classes and biological pathways. In the experiments on disease phenotype-gene associations in OMIM and KEGG disease pathways, R-NMTF significantly improved the classification of disease phenotypes and disease pathway genes compared with support vector machines and Label Propagation in cross-validation on the annotated phenotypes and genes. The newly predicted phenotypes in each disease class are highly consistent with human phenotype ontology annotations. The roles of the new member genes in the disease pathways are examined and validated in the protein-protein interaction subnetworks. Extensive literature review also confirmed many new members of the disease classes and pathways as well as the predicted associations between disease phenotype classes and pathways.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Clinical diseases are characterized by distinct phenotypes. To identify disease genes is to elucidate the gene-phenotype relationships. Mutations in functionally related genes may result in similar phenotypes. It is reasonable to predict disease-causing genes by integrating phenotypic data and genomic data. Some genetic diseases are genetically or phenotypically similar. They may share the common pathogenetic mechanisms. Identifying the relationship between diseases will facilitate better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanism of diseases.

RESULTS: In this article, we constructed a heterogeneous network by connecting the gene network and phenotype network using the phenotype-gene relationship information from the OMIM database. We extended the random walk with restart algorithm to the heterogeneous network. The algorithm prioritizes the genes and phenotypes simultaneously. We use leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate the ability of finding the gene-phenotype relationship. Results showed improved performance than previous works. We also used the algorithm to disclose hidden disease associations that cannot be found by gene network or phenotype network alone. We identified 18 hidden disease associations, most of which were supported by literature evidence.

@article{Lock2013,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: In biomedical research a growing number of platforms and technologies are used to measure diverse but related information, and the task of clustering a set of objects based on multiple sources of data arises in several applications. Most current approaches to multisource clustering either independently determine a separate clustering for each data source or determine a single 'joint' clustering for all data sources. There is a need for more flexible approaches that simultaneously model the dependence and the heterogeneity of the data sources.

RESULTS: We propose an integrative statistical model that permits a separate clustering of the objects for each data source. These separate clusterings adhere loosely to an overall consensus clustering, and hence they are not independent. We describe a computationally scalable Bayesian framework for simultaneous estimation of both the consensus clustering and the source-specific clusterings. We demonstrate that this flexible approach is more robust than joint clustering of all data sources, and is more powerful than clustering each data source independently. We present an application to subtype identification of breast cancer tumor samples using publicly available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas.

abstract = {Research in several fields now requires the analysis of datasets in which multiple high-dimensional types of data are available for a common set of objects. In particular, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) includes data from several diverse genomic technologies on the same cancerous tumor samples. In this paper we introduce Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE), a general decomposition of variation for the integrated analysis of such datasets. The decomposition consists of three terms: a low-rank approximation capturing joint variation across data types, low-rank approximations for structured variation individual to each data type, and residual noise. JIVE quantifies the amount of joint variation between data types, reduces the dimensionality of the data, and provides new directions for the visual exploration of joint and individual structure. The proposed method represents an extension of Principal Component Analysis and has clear advantages over popular two-block methods such as Canonical Correlation Analysis and Partial Least Squares. A JIVE analysis of gene expression and miRNA data on Glioblastoma Multiforme tumor samples reveals gene-miRNA associations and provides better characterization of tumor types.},

@article{Vanunu2010,
abstract = {A fundamental challenge in human health is the identification of disease-causing genes. Recently, several studies have tackled this challenge via a network-based approach, motivated by the observation that genes causing the same or similar diseases tend to lie close to one another in a network of protein-protein or functional interactions. However, most of these approaches use only local network information in the inference process and are restricted to inferring single gene associations. Here, we provide a global, network-based method for prioritizing disease genes and inferring protein complex associations, which we call PRINCE. The method is based on formulating constraints on the prioritization function that relate to its smoothness over the network and usage of prior information. We exploit this function to predict not only genes but also protein complex associations with a disease of interest. We test our method on gene-disease association data, evaluating both the prioritization achieved and the protein complexes inferred. We show that our method outperforms extant approaches in both tasks. Using data on 1,369 diseases from the OMIM knowledgebase, our method is able (in a cross validation setting) to rank the true causal gene first for 34{\%} of the diseases, and infer 139 disease-related complexes that are highly coherent in terms of the function, expression and conservation of their member proteins. Importantly, we apply our method to study three multi-factorial diseases for which some causal genes have been found already: prostate cancer, alzheimer and type 2 diabetes mellitus. PRINCE's predictions for these diseases highly match the known literature, suggesting several novel causal genes and protein complexes for further investigation.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Understanding the complexity in gene-phenotype relationship is vital for revealing the genetic basis of common diseases. Recent studies on the basis of human interactome and phenome not only uncovers prevalent phenotypic overlap and genetic overlap between diseases, but also reveals a modular organization of the genetic landscape of human diseases, providing new opportunities to reduce the complexity in dissecting the gene-phenotype association.

RESULTS: We provide systematic and quantitative evidence that phenotypic overlap implies genetic overlap. With these results, we perform the first heterogeneous alignment of human interactome and phenome via a network alignment technique and identify 39 disease families with corresponding causative gene networks. Finally, we propose AlignPI, an alignment-based framework to predict disease genes, and identify plausible candidates for 70 diseases. Our method scales well to the whole genome, as demonstrated by prioritizing 6154 genes across 37 chromosome regions for Crohn's disease (CD). Results are consistent with a recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for CD.

abstract = {The goal of pathway analysis is to identify the pathways significantly impacted in a given phenotype. Many current methods are based on algorithms that consider pathways as simple gene lists, dramatically under-utilizing the knowledge that such pathways are meant to capture. During the past few years, a plethora of methods claiming to incorporate various aspects of the pathway topology have been proposed. These topology-based methods, sometimes referred to as "third generation," have the potential to better model the phenomena described by pathways. Although there is now a large variety of approaches used for this purpose, no review is currently available to offer guidance for potential users and developers. This review covers 22 such topology-based pathway analysis methods published in the last decade. We compare these methods based on: type of pathways analyzed (e.g., signaling or metabolic), input (subset of genes, all genes, fold changes, gene p-values, etc.), mathematical models, pathway scoring approaches, output (one or more pathway scores, p-values, etc.) and implementation (web-based, standalone, etc.). We identify and discuss challenges, arising both in methodology and in pathway representation, including inconsistent terminology, different data formats, lack of meaningful benchmarks, and the lack of tissue and condition specificity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein-protein interaction networks and phenotype similarity information have been synthesized together to discover novel disease-causing genes. Genetic or phenotypic similarities are manifested as certain modularity properties in a phenotype-gene heterogeneous network consisting of the phenotype-phenotype similarity network, protein-protein interaction network and gene-disease association network. However, the quantitative analysis of modularity in the heterogeneous network and its influence on disease-gene discovery are still unaddressed. Furthermore, the genetic correspondence of the disease subtypes can be identified by marking the genes and phenotypes in the phenotype-gene network. We present a novel network inference method to measure the network modularity, and in particular to suggest the subtypes of diseases based on the heterogeneous network.

RESULTS: Based on a measure which is introduced to evaluate the closeness between two nodes in the phenotype-gene heterogeneous network, we developed a Hitting-Time-based method, CIPHER-HIT, for assessing the modularity of disease gene predictions and credibly prioritizing disease-causing genes, and then identifying the genetic modules corresponding to potential subtypes of the queried phenotype. The CIPHER-HIT is free to rely on any preset parameters. We found that when taking into account the modularity levels, the CIPHER-HIT method can significantly improve the performance of disease gene predictions, which demonstrates modularity is one of the key features for credible inference of disease genes on the phenotype-gene heterogeneous network. By applying the CIPHER-HIT to the subtype analysis of Breast cancer, we found that the prioritized genes can be divided into two sub-modules, one contains the members of the Fanconi anemia gene family, and the other contains a reported protein complex MRE11/RAD50/NBN.

CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype-gene heterogeneous network contains abundant information for not only disease genes discovery but also disease subtypes detection. The CIPHER-HIT method presented here is effective for network inference, particularly on credible prediction of disease genes and the subtype analysis of diseases, for example Breast cancer. This method provides a promising way to analyze heterogeneous biological networks, both globally and locally.},

abstract = {Evidence from many sources suggests that similar phenotypes are begotten by functionally related genes. This is most obvious in the case of genetically heterogeneous diseases such as Fanconi anemia, Bardet-Biedl or Usher syndrome, where the various genes work together in a single biological module. Such modules can be a multiprotein complex, a pathway, or a single cellular or subcellular organelle. This observation suggests a number of hypotheses about the human phenome that are now beginning to be explored. First, there is now good evidence from bioinformatic analyses that human genetic diseases can be clustered on the basis of their phenotypic similarities and that such a clustering represents true biological relationships of the genes involved. Second, one may use such phenotypic similarity to predict and then test for the contribution of apparently unrelated genes to the same functional module. This concept is now being systematically tested for several diseases. Most recently, a systematic yeast two-hybrid screen of all known genes for inherited ataxias indicated that they all form part of a single extended protein-protein interaction network. Third, one can use bioinformatics to make predictions about new genes for diseases that form part of the same phenotype cluster. This is done by starting from the known disease genes and then searching for genes that share one or more functional attributes such as gene expression pattern, coevolution, or gene ontology. Ultimately, one may expect that a modular view of disease genes should help the rapid identification of additional disease genes for multifactorial diseases once the first few contributing genes (or environmental factors) have been reliably identified.},

Despite its unprecedented coverage, a large percentage of missing data substantially constrains joint trait analysis. Meanwhile, the trait data is characterized by the hierarchical phylogenetic structure of the plant kingdom. While factorization based matrix completion techniques have been widely used to address the missing data problem, traditional matrix factorization methods are unable to leverage the phylogenetic structure. We propose hierarchical probabilistic matrix factorization (HPMF), which effectively uses hierarchical phylogenetic information for trait prediction. We demonstrate HPMF's high accuracy, effectiveness of incorporating hierarchical structure and ability to capture trait correlation through experiments.},

abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

abstract = {Community detection and analysis is an important methodology for understanding the organization of various real-world networks and has applications in problems as diverse as consensus formation in social communities or the identification of functional modules in biochemical networks. Currently used algorithms that identify the community structures in large-scale real-world networks require a priori information such as the number and sizes of communities or are computationally expensive. In this paper we investigate a simple label propagation algorithm that uses the network structure alone as its guide and requires neither optimization of a pre-defined objective function nor prior information about the communities. In our algorithm every node is initialized with a unique label and at every step each node adopts the label that most of its neighbors currently have. In this iterative process densely connected groups of nodes form a consensus on a unique label to form communities. We validate the algorithm by applying it to networks whose community structures are known. We also demonstrate that the algorithm takes an almost linear time and hence it is computationally less expensive than what was possible so far.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Compared with sequence and structure similarity, functional similarity is more informative for understanding the biological roles and functions of genes. Many important applications in computational molecular biology require functional similarity, such as gene clustering, protein function prediction, protein interaction evaluation and disease gene prioritization. Gene Ontology (GO) is now widely used as the basis for measuring gene functional similarity. Some existing methods combined semantic similarity scores of single term pairs to estimate gene functional similarity, whereas others compared terms in groups to measure it. However, these methods may make error-prone judgments about gene functional similarity. It remains a challenge that measuring gene functional similarity reliably.

RESULT: We propose a novel method called SORA to measure gene functional similarity in GO context. First of all, SORA computes the information content (IC) of a term making use of semantic specificity and coverage. Second, SORA measures the IC of a term set by means of combining inherited and extended IC of the terms based on the structure of GO. Finally, SORA estimates gene functional similarity using the IC overlap ratio of term sets. SORA is evaluated against five state-of-the-art methods in the file on the public platform for collaborative evaluation of GO-based semantic similarity measure. The carefully comparisons show SORA is superior to other methods in general. Further analysis suggests that it primarily benefits from the structure of GO, which implies expressive information about gene function. SORA offers an effective and reliable way to compare gene function.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes is a necessary and critical step in the analysis of microarray data. The distributed nature of biological knowledge frequently requires researchers to navigate through numerous web-accessible databases gathering information one gene at a time. A more judicious approach is to provide query-based access to an integrated database that disseminates biologically rich information across large datasets and displays graphic summaries of functional information.

RESULTS: Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID; http://www.david.niaid.nih.gov) addresses this need via four web-based analysis modules: 1) Annotation Tool - rapidly appends descriptive data from several public databases to lists of genes; 2) GoCharts - assigns genes to Gene Ontology functional categories based on user selected classifications and term specificity level; 3) KeggCharts - assigns genes to KEGG metabolic processes and enables users to view genes in the context of biochemical pathway maps; and 4) DomainCharts - groups genes according to PFAM conserved protein domains.

CONCLUSIONS: Analysis results and graphical displays remain dynamically linked to primary data and external data repositories, thereby furnishing in-depth as well as broad-based data coverage. The functionality provided by DAVID accelerates the analysis of genome-scale datasets by facilitating the transition from data collection to biological meaning.},

Polymorphisms within NF-$\kappa$B pathway genes may influence cancer risk. This study aimed to examine the association between NFKB19-4 ATTG insdel, NFKBIA 3' UTR AG, -826CT and -881AG polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk among Chinese.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The polymorphisms were genotyped via PCR-RFLP technique on 936 prostate cancer patients and 936 population-based healthy controls. Logistic regression model was used to measure the risk association present.

RESULTS: With the exception of NFKBIA 3' UTR polymorphism, the heterozygous and mutant genotypes of the other polymorphisms were significantly associated with prostate cancer risk. For NFKB1 polymorphism, a decreased risk was observed, with adjusted OR: 0.69; 95{\%} CI: 0.44, 0.98; P=0.01 (heterozygous) and adjusted OR: 0.60; 95{\%} CI: 0.37, 0.91; P=0.02 (mutant). NFKBIA -826CT and -881AG polymorphisms were in complete linkage disequilibrium and shared the same risk association, with adjusted OR: 1.34; 95{\%} CI: 1.09, 1.62; P=0.02 (heterozygous) and adjusted OR: 2.83; 95{\%} CI: 1.79, 4.50; P=0.01 (mutants). Interestingly, the impact of the NFKB1 polymorphism was not present in nonsmokers and younger (<60 years) subjects (P<0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, polymorphisms in NFKB1 and NFKBIA genes may modulate the risk of developing prostate cancer among Chinese.},

abstract = {Despite the high incidence and mortality of prostate cancer, the etiology of this disease is not fully understood. In this study, we develop functional evidence for CBP and PTEN interaction in prostate cancer based on findings of their correlate expression in the human disease. Cbp(pc-/-);Pten(pc+/-) mice exhibited higher cell proliferation in the prostate and an early onset of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Levels of EZH2 methyltransferase were increased along with its Thr350 phosphorylation in both mouse Cbp(-/-); Pten(+/-) and human prostate cancer cells. CBP loss and PTEN deficiency cooperated to trigger a switch from K27-acetylated histone H3 to K27-trimethylated bulk histones in a manner associated with decreased expression of the growth inhibitory EZH2 target genes DAB2IP, p27(KIP1), and p21(CIP1). Conversely, treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat reversed this switch, in a manner associated with tumor suppression in Cbp(pc-/-);Pten(pc+/-) mice. Our findings show how CBP and PTEN interact to mediate tumor suppression in the prostate, establishing a central role for histone modification in the etiology of prostate cancer and providing a rationale for clinical evaluation of epigenetic-targeted therapy in patients with prostate cancer.},

abstract = {The androgen receptor (AR) is a critical effector of prostate cancer development and progression. The dependence of this tumor type on AR activity is exploited in treatment of disseminated prostate cancers, wherein ablation of AR function (achieved either through ligand depletion and/or the use of AR antagonists) is the first line of therapeutic intervention. These strategies are initially effective, and induce a mixed response of cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. However, recurrent, incurable tumors ultimately arise as a result of inappropriately restored AR function. Based on these observations, it is imperative to define the mechanisms by which AR controls cancer cell proliferation. Mechanistic investigation has revealed that AR acts as a master regulator of G1-S phase progression, able to induce signals that promote G1 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity, induce phosphorylation/inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB), and thereby govern androgen-dependent proliferation. These functions appear to be independent of the recently identified TMPRSS2-ETS fusions. Once engaged, several components of the cell cycle machinery actively modulate AR activity throughout the cell cycle, thus indicating that crosstalk between the AR and cell cycle pathways likely modulate the mitogenic response to androgen. As will be discussed, discrete aberrations in this process can alter the proliferative response to androgen, and potentially subvert hormonal control of tumor progression.},

abstract = {Androgens and androgen receptors (AR) play a pivotal role in expression of the male phenotype. Several diseases, such as androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and prostate cancer, are associated with alterations in AR functions. Indeed, androgen blockade by drugs that prevent the production of androgens and/or block the action of the AR inhibits prostate cancer growth. However, resistance to these drugs often occurs after 2-3 years as the patients develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In CRPC, a functional AR remains a key regulator. Early studies focused on the functional domains of the AR and its crucial role in the pathology. The elucidation of the structures of the AR DNA binding domain (DBD) and ligand binding domain (LBD) provides a new framework for understanding the functions of this receptor and leads to the development of rational drug design for the treatment of prostate cancer. An overview of androgen receptor structure and activity, its actions in prostate cancer, and how structural information and high-throughput screening have been or can be used for drug discovery are provided herein.},

abstract = {African-American (AA) men experience an increased risk of developing prostate cancers as well as increased mortality following treatment as compared to European-American (EA) men. The aim of our study was to identify biological factors with the potential to predispose AA men to prostate tumor progression and metastasis. To identify cancer-specific gene expression patterns in AA men, we established primary prostate cancer epithelial cells from 14 AA and 13 EA men. High-throughput microarrays were used to investigate differences in global gene expression comparing the two groups. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry validated mRNA and protein expression levels. RNAi knockdowns provided support for biological significance for the identified genes in prostate cancer cells. Son of sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1) was overexpressed in AA male-derived primary prostate cancer epithelial cells. Depletion of SOS1 in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells resulted in decreased capacities for cell proliferation, migration and invasion, at least partially through inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2. Tissue microarray analyses of SOS1 expression in prostate carcinomas correlated with Gleason's grades of tumors, consistent with a possible role in prostate cancer progression. Investigation of prostate cancer-derived epithelial cells has led to identification of SOS1 as a potential candidate biomarker and molecular therapeutic target in prostate cancer in AA men, consistent with the hypothesis that a biological basis exists for prostate cancer aggressiveness in AA men.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Increased endogenous glucose production is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. Evidence from animal models has suggested that a likely cause of this is increased mRNA expression of glucose 6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (encoded by G6PC, PCK1 and PCK2). But another contributing factor may be decreased liver glucokinase (encoded by GCK).

METHODS: We examined expression of these enzymes in liver biopsies from 12 nondiabetic and 28 diabetic individuals. Diabetic patients were further separated into those with HbA1c lower or higher than 7.0.

RESULTS: In diabetic subjects with HbA1c?>?7.0, we found that gluconeogenic enzymes were expressed normally, but GCK was suppressed more than 60{\%}. Moreover, HbA1c and fasting glucose were negatively correlated with GCK, but showed no correlation with G6PC, PCK1, or PCK2.

CONCLUSION: These findings suggest an underlying dysregulation of hepatic GCK expression during frank diabetes, which has implications for the therapeutic use of glucokinase activators in this population.},

abstract = {The novel diabetic mouse model Munich Ins2(C95S) was discovered within the Munich N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mouse mutagenesis screen. These mice exhibit a T-->A transversion in the insulin 2 (Ins2) gene at nucleotide position 1903 in exon 3, which leads to the amino acid exchange C95S and loss of the A6-A11 intrachain disulfide bond. From 1 month of age onwards, blood glucose levels of heterozygous Munich Ins2(C95S) mutant mice were significantly increased compared with controls. The fasted and postprandial serum insulin levels of the heterozygous mutants were indistinguishable from those of wild-type littermates. However, serum insulin levels after glucose challenge, pancreatic insulin content, and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) beta-cell indices of heterozygous mutants were significantly lower than those of wild-type littermates. The initial blood glucose decrease during an insulin tolerance test was lower and HOMA insulin resistance indices were significantly higher in mutant mice, indicating the development of insulin resistance in mutant mice. The total islet volume, the volume density of beta-cells in the islets, and the total beta-cell volume of heterozygous male mutants was significantly reduced compared with wild-type mice. Electron microscopy of the beta-cells of male mutants showed virtually no secretory insulin granules, the endoplasmic reticulum was severely enlarged, and mitochondria appeared swollen. Thus, Munich Ins2(C95S) mutant mice are considered a valuable model to study the mechanisms of beta-cell dysfunction and death during the development of diabetes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} OBJECTIVES: TNF-$\alpha$ is an adipocytokine that has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance. Dysregulation of TNF-$\alpha$ production has been implicated in a variety of human diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus. We aimed to find out the association of TNF-$\alpha$ levels with insulin resistance, body mass index and waist hip ratio; and to elicit its role with respect to duration of the disease, if any.

METHODS: 50 type-2 diabetic patients attending Narayana Medical Hospital, Nellore, were studied. Body mass index and Waist hip ratio were calculated. Homeostasis model assessment method was used to calculate insulin resistance (HOMA IR) and per cent $\beta$ cell function (HOMA B). Insulin was estimated by chemiluminescence method and TNF-$\alpha$ by ELISA method. The subjects were arbitrarily categorized into three groups based on duration of diabetes. Group 1 included subjects with diabetes of less than 5 yr duration, group 2 included diabetics of 6-10 yr duration and group 3 greater than 10 yr duration.

RESULTS: Our study revealed a significant correlation between TNF-$\alpha$ levels and BMI (P=0.006), the correlation being stronger in males when compared to females. A significant correlation was found between per cent $\beta$ cell function and TNF-$\alpha$ (P=0.008). TNF-$\alpha$ correlated significantly with HOMA IR, HOMA B and insulin, in group 2 diabetes.

INTERPRETATION {\&} CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the possible role of TNF-$\alpha$ in the pathogenesis of type-2 diabetes mellitus and the importance of reducing obesity to prevent elevated levels of the cytokine and related complications.},

Our approach is based on a Bayesian model of networks that allows nodes to participate in multiple communities, and a corresponding algorithm that naturally interleaves subsampling from the network and updating an estimate of its communities. We demonstrate how we can discover the hidden community structure of several real-world networks, including 3.7 million US patents, 575,000 physics articles from the arXiv preprint server, and 875,000 connected Web pages from the Internet. Furthermore, we demonstrate on large simulated networks that our algorithm accurately discovers the true community structure.

We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known--a collaboration network and a food web--and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

abstract = {Various biological networks can be constructed, each featuring gene/protein relationships of different meanings (e.g., protein interactions or gene co-expression). However, this diversity is classically not considered and the different interaction categories are usually aggregated in a single network. The multiplex framework, where biological relationships are represented by different network layers reflecting the various nature of interactions, is expected to retain more information. Here we assessed aggregation, consensus and multiplex-modularity approaches to detect communities from multiple network sources. By simulating random networks, we demonstrated that the multiplex-modularity method outperforms the aggregation and consensus approaches when network layers are incomplete or heterogeneous in density. Application to a multiplex biological network containing 4 layers of physical or functional interactions allowed recovering communities more accurately annotated than their aggregated counterparts. Overall, taking into account the multiplexity of biological networks leads to better-defined functional modules. A user-friendly graphical software to detect communities from multiplex networks, and corresponding C source codes, are available at GitHub (https://github.com/gilles-didier/MolTi).},

Data representation plays an important role in clustering analysis. The non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a widely used data representation method with great success in machine learning. Although the traditional manifold regularization method, Laplacian regularization (LR), can improve the performance of NMF, LR still suffers from the problem of its weak extrapolating power. Hessian regularization (HR) is a newly developed manifold regularization method, whose natural properties make it more extrapolating, especially for small sample data. In this work, we propose the HR-based NMF (HR-NMF) algorithm, and then apply it to represent gene expression data for further clustering task. The clustering experiments are conducted on five commonly used gene datasets, and the results indicate that the proposed HR-NMF outperforms LR-based NMM and original NMF, which suggests the potential application of HR-NMF for gene expression data.},

Nevertheless, many practical applications demand constrained algorithms in which a small number of constraints in the form of must-link and cannot-link are available. In this paper, we propose an NMF-based constrained clustering framework in which the similarity between two points on a must-link is enforced to approximate 1 and the similarity between two points on a cannot-link is enforced to approximate 0. We then formulate the framework using NMF and SymNMF to deal with clustering of linearly separable data and nonlinearly separable data, respectively. Furthermore, we present multiplicative update rules to solve them and show the correctness and convergence. Experimental results on various text data sets, University of California, Irvine (UCI) data sets, and gene expression data sets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over existing constrained clustering algorithms.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Tremendous amount of omics data being accumulated poses a pressing challenge of meta-analyzing the heterogeneous data for mining new biological knowledge. Most existing methods deal with each gene independently, thus often resulting in high false positive rates in detecting differentially expressed genes (DEG). To our knowledge, no or little effort has been devoted to methods that consider dependence structures underlying transcriptomics data for DEG identification in meta-analysis context.

RESULTS: This article proposes a new meta-analysis method for identification of DEGs based on joint non-negative matrix factorization (jNMFMA). We mathematically extend non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to a joint version (jNMF), which is used to simultaneously decompose multiple transcriptomics data matrices into one common submatrix plus multiple individual submatrices. By the jNMF, the dependence structures underlying transcriptomics data can be interrogated and utilized, while the high-dimensional transcriptomics data are mapped into a low-dimensional space spanned by metagenes that represent hidden biological signals. jNMFMA finally identifies DEGs as genes that are associated with differentially expressed metagenes. The ability of extracting dependence structures makes jNMFMA more efficient and robust to identify DEGs in meta-analysis context. Furthermore, jNMFMA is also flexible to identify DEGs that are consistent among various types of omics data, e.g. gene expression and DNA methylation. Experimental results on both simulation data and real-world cancer data demonstrate the effectiveness of jNMFMA and its superior performance over other popular approaches.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: R code for jNMFMA is available for non-commercial use via http://micblab.iim.ac.cn/Download/.
